Hi! This is a Cocktail Database React app.

This is built to work with the external API from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ 

The amount of individual objects is not hardcoded anywhere, the code just iterates through
a JSON list and renders as needed, so, even if the number of items changes, the app would work anyway, requiring
no maitenance at all.
